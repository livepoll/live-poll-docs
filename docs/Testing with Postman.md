## Testing
In order to be able to test our endpoints quickly and easily during development, we use Postman. In Postman we have created a collection, which helps us to send individual queries to certain endpoints. Furthermore we use Postman to test all endpoints at once.

### Select the entpoints
Here we can see all the endpoints that currently exist in the collection and we can select whether they should be tested in this collection run or not.
