## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Vision
Live-Poll is the vision of an open-source live-polling application that you can use totally free, no matter if youâ€™re a private person, school, university, society, small or big business etc. Our idea arose from the lack of free live voting/polling software on the Internet that has a nice user flow and is easy to use.

Live Poll will elevate your presentation and let you stand out from the crowd. It is an online tool allowing your audience to live-interact with the presenters, e.g. to answer questions, quizzes, multiple choice questions, word clouds and so much more.
